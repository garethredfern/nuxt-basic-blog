### A Paragraph

This is a paragraph of text which has all the most common html elements in it such as the **strong element** which is used to give text strong importance. You could of course use the <b>b element</b> which represents a span of text stylistically different from normal text, without conveying any special importance or relevance. The <mark>mark element</mark> which represents highlighted text, i.e., a run of text marked for reference purposes. _The HTML em element marks text that has stress emphasis._ You could of course use the <i>i element</i> which represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, for example, technical terms, foreign language phrases, or fictional character thoughts. <i>It is typically displayed in italic type</i>. The next piece of text is marked up using the code element `function()` and finally links will be styled [like this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/a).
